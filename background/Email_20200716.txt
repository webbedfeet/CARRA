Hi Abhijit



I hope you are doing well. Laura and I met with our writing group. We are getting close to getting the paper together for submission. We need help with a few things:



    Could you provide us with a demographics breakdown so we can do a table 1 with
        Age at enrollment
        Gender
        Ethnicity
        Time since diagnosis



    The total number of LN cases were reported as 234 and 235 different places throughout the data. Could you help clarify this?



    For principle 2,  the total of LN is 217 instead of 235. I think this wasn’t updated when we added in the rest of the nephritis patients (class I and II) to principle 1



    For principle 2, can we do a kaplan meyer curve for time to nephritis



    For principle 3, can you please report the UPC by class both the numerical and categorical variable? I know the data is limited but we’d like to report what we have



    For principle 4, the GFR table total is 234 not 235 including NA. Where did the one patient go?



    For principle 5, what is the p-value for the change in GFR? Can we do this by collapsing state 2 and state 3 into one group and compare GFR >60 vs <60?



    For principle 6, for the top medications- which patients are being compared? What is the denominator?



Thanks!

Kathleen and Laura
