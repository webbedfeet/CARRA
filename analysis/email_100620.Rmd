For the demographics table we have from the prior analysis, there are a total of 677 subjects. In the new analysis, there are 675 subjects. Did we lose two subjects? Are there 2 where it is unclear of their LN status? Do we need a new demographics table to reflect 675 subjects?
:::

I have normalized this table to the 675 patients for whom we have biopsy data

For principle 4, we had several p-values reported. Have those been updated to reflect the reanalysis? The p-values we had previously were:

1.  Black LN patients had worse renal outcomes compared to White patients, including increased progression to Stage 3, 4, or 5 CKD (9.8% of Black patients compared to 2.4% of White patients, p=0.04).
1. Achievement of remission black vs non-black p-value

Similarly for principle 5, we had a couple of p-values that I suspect need updating:

1. For patients who had a recorded eGFR >60 at diagnosis (n=38), 13 (34.2%) achieved remission; in comparison, for patients with eGFR recorded as 30-60 at diagnosis (n=8), 1 (12.5%) achieved remission (see Figure 2); neither of the 2 patients with eGFR <30 at diagnosis achieved remission, and these differences were not statistically significant (p= 0.45).
1. For patients with multiple recorded eGFRs, of those with an initial eGFR >60 (n=114), 109 (95.6%), 5 (4.4%) progressed to stage 3-5 CKD.  Whereas of the 9 patients with an initial eGFR <60, 2 (22.2%) continued to have an eGFR <60 (p=0.46).

For principle 6, we had made a table comparing usage of rituximab and other medications only in patients with lupus nephritis. Can you make this table again based on the reanalysis? I donâ€™t see it in the github. For reference, this is the prior table:
